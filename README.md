Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Android/Androamdus, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/download/using-repo).

To initialize your local repository using the Andromadus trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/Andromadus/android.git -b cm-11.0

Then to sync up:

  repo sync
